# Goal-Selection-PRIMs

This repository contains all the material used to write my master thesis (file MasterThesis.pdf).

## Types of files

### .prims

Tasks on which the model was tested. Tasks "category", "paired-associate", "press-key" and "recall" were designed by Dr Niels Taatgen.

### .bprims

Batch files. For the control simulations (control_noreset_test or task_control1430/10000) these are classical PRIMs batch files. 
For the random and the progress driven conditions (random.bprims and accuderiv.bprims) the files only contains the first sequence of tasks that the model performs, after that, autonomous goal selection takes place.

### .ipynb

#### Preprocessing

Notebook dedicated to the creation of the csv files from the dat files generated by PRIMs_cmd.
